# polar
 A code for computing molecular polarizabilities in electronic and vibrational spectroscopy
 
 The polar code was written by Matteo Tommasini and was instrumental to carry out the calculations described in [1], where the role of molecular polarizability is investigated in the context of electronic and vibrational circular dichroism spectroscopies.

 Polar results were assessed by the authors of the cited paper [1]. Unfortunately, due to development time restrictions, the source code is scarcely commented and documented. Potential users of the code can examine the test directory for examples of calculations. Furthermore, I can be contacted for details (my address can be found in [1]). I am open to collaboration to document the code and improve its readability.
